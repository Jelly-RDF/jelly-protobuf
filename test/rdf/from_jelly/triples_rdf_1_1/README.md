TODO: replace this with manifests

## Positive cases

- `pos_001` – single frame (delimited), a few basic triples. Prefix table enabled.
- `pos_002` – single frame (delimited), a few basic triples (same content as `pos_001`). Prefix table disabled.
- `pos_003` – TODO: same as `pos_002`, but non-delimited.

## Negative cases

TODO: include info in the manifest on why and how should the consumer fail

- `neg_001` – TODO: overly large prefix table.
